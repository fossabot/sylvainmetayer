## Prerequisite

- `apt-get install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev` or `dnf install libcurl-devel gcc ruby-devel zlib-devel`
- `ruby` and `gem install bundler`
- run `bundle install`

OR

- docker
- docker-compose

## Start it locally

`bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml --drafts`

## Start it with docker

- `make`

    > The server need some time to intialize at first, because it will install all dependencies.
    >
    > Use `make logs` to check when the server is alive

## Available commands

- Create a draft : `make name=POST_NAME draft`
- Publish a draft : `make name=./_drafts/FILE.md publish`
- Show Jekyll commands : `make help`
- Tests: `make test`
- Clean environment : `make clean`
- Logs: `make logs`

## Travis configuration

If you want to use travis, you will have to generate the following variables with the [Travis CLI (ruby)](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/#usage):

- `travis login` to log in your travis account.

- a private SSH key, to connect to the deploy server.

    To do so, first generate a SSH key and run this command (replacing FILE with the **private** key) : `travis encrypt-file FILE --add`

    The public key must be added to the user `authorized_keys` ssh config, on the remote host

    **Do not version the unencrypted ssh private key !!**

- `travis encrypt DEPLOY_USER=SOME_USER --add`

    This is used to tell travis which user is used to connect to the remote server.

- `travis encrypt DEPLOY_HOST=DOMAIN.FR --add`

    This tells travis where your SSH server is located (can be an IP or a domain)

- `travis encrypt DEPLOY_DIRECTORY_DEV=/var/www/dev.sylvainmetayer.fr --add`

    This tells travis where to deploy your development application on the remote host.

- `travis encrypt DEPLOY_DIRECTORY=SOME_REMOTE_PATH --add`

    This tells travis where to deploy your application on the remote host.
